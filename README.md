# Rhenpo-Data
I found that an app that helps me track my workout and measurement could be exported as CSV file. The result is just a demonstration of ETL process in Python

### Required Module
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sn
```
### Demonstration
